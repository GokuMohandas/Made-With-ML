We repeat this for every sentence in our corpus and this results in our training data for the unsupervised task.

extract the highest value from each of our `num_filters` for each `filter_size`. We could also follow this same approach to figure out which n-gram is most relevant but notice in the heatmap above that many filters don't have much variance. To mitigate this, this [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5408/) uses threshold values to determine which filters to use for interpretability.
