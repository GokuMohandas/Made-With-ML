They commonly suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients as a result using the same set of weights ($W_{xh}$ and $W_{hh}$) with each timestep's input. During backpropagation, this can cause gradients to explode (>1) or vanish (<1). If you multiply any number greater than 1 with itself over and over, it moves towards infinity (exploding gradients) and similarly,  If you multiply any number less than 1 with itself over and over, it moves towards zero (vanishing gradients). To mitigate this issue, gated RNNs were devised to selectively retrain information.
